Week 1:
We worked to get the Github setup working, learning to push and pull to local from remote, and push to it. It was almost easy, just a few hiccups with ssh. The group now has 5 members, and I am excited to learn in this class, and I am glad I am taking the Linux class this year and built a linux machine at home, it makes it so much easier.

Week 2:
We threw out ideas for the You Face Website this week, the popular idea was to make a very inconvenient social media. Like font is wingdings, terrible background colors, terrible passwords, etc.
